### Model Implementation

All the models are implemented in the `models` directory. All the models inherit from the class `BaseModel` from `models/base_model.py` all the training methods and logging functions.

The data loading is done in the file `data.py`.

To train the model run `train.py`

`inference.py` is still TODO
